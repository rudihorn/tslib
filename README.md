#`tslib`

This is supposed to be an implementation of the rust [embedded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) package for STM32F103 microcontrollers.

This library is mainly an experimentation for using less macros and more of the Rust type system and something in the direction of type state to detect various errors etc.
